# Foundry VTT Docker

> [Foundry Virtual Tabeltop](https://foundryvtt.com) is a self-hosted and modern roleplaying platform for playing various tabletop RPG games, such as Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, Aliens, and more..
 
## Foundry VTT Docker

This repository contains the source 'Dockerfile' and scripts for [dumaurier/foundry-docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dumaurier/foundry-docker/general) on Docker Hub.

As well as the various scripts and files required for composing the docker container, I have included an example docker-compose.yml file, that can be used as a starting point, for getting your own server up and running quickly.

### **Note**
As Foundry VTT is a paid for product, and a license is required to run the software, this container does NOT contain, or include, any source code, or content for Foundry VTT, and you will need to download the zip file from the [official Foundry VTT website](https://foundryvtt.com).
